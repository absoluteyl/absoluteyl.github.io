I'm a Ruby on Rails developer with 7 years in experience who's also a product engineering team leader of KKTV. I also write Solidity, Python and Golang projects and maintain all these projects mainly on AWS.

As the leader of engineering team, I work closely with product owners and designers to provide various data and technical
insights, aiding in product decision-making. I effectively translated these insights into development requirements and
coordinated team members to implement them.

My work experience showcases not only my proficiency in problem analysis and resolution but also my strong
communication and teamwork abilities. Outside of work, I continuously pursue anything new in technology and body
workout aspect, seeking personal growth and expanding my life experiences.
